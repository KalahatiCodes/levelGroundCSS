In this project I utilized the foundations of HTML and CSS to create a clean website for Level Ground Fitness. The code includes effective indentation and is optimized by adding media queries to ensure that the website is responsive to several different screen sizes. Because it isn't a desktop application and is meant to be viewed on the go and easilty readable for those that find the website via social media, it was important that the viewability of this project has a broad range.

# Lessons Learned:
Based on the coders choice of measurement greatly impacts the ability to make your application reponsive. I personally lean toward percentages.
